        <h1>Chapter I :</h1>
        <p>One night, Alex, who was very tired, got lost in a town he didn't know. It was foggy, and rain was hitting his car windows as he tried to find his way. Unfortunately, he took a wrong turn and ended up on a quiet road. Suddenly, his car slid on the wet road and crashed into a mysterious gate covered in fog.</p>
        <p> Feeling confused and dizzy, Alex stepped out of his car, which was now broken. The gate opened with a creepy sound, showing the way to Terror Tunnelsâ€”a place he didn't plan to go. A mysterious person, the game master, came forward from the mist with a lantern, giving Alex a strange and unsettling greeting.</p>
        <p>Since his car was now broken, and the storm was getting worse, Alex agreed, though not very excitedly, to take on the challenge. The game master told him he had only one hour to go through the tunnels and get out of the spooky mansion. The entrance gate closed with a creepy feeling as he went inside.</p>
        <p>Alone, with only the dim light of his lantern cutting through the darkness, Alex entered the foreboding mansion. The echoes of his footsteps mixed with the distant whispers of unseen spirits, creating an atmosphere of both trepidation and determination. </p>

        <p>  In the first room, Alex saw an antique clock with lots of details. When he looked closely, he found small symbols cleverly mixed into the clock's design. After figuring them out, he saw that the symbols matched certain numbers on the clock face.</p>
