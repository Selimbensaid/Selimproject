        <h1>Final Chapter  :</h1>
        <p> In the last room, Alex solved the mysterious riddle â€” "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?" His clever answer was recognized, and a hidden exit appeared behind rearranged boxes. Well done!
        </p>
        <p>Walking through the doorway brought him to a courtyard lit by the moon, and the storm had passed. The game master praised him, and the mansion, once spooky, turned into a magnificent building. With a handshake from the game master, he found himself back at the town entrance, and his car was fixed. Great job!
        </p>

            While driving away, Alex thought about the strange adventure, taking with him the lessons from Terror Tunnels. Leaving the night behind, he continued his journey, appreciative of the unexpected challenges and newfound strengths uncovered when facing the unknown.
